Insert Data from seeder using "php artisan db:seed"

Use this command to generate report and get Email notifications
       "php artisan report:generate-users";

I use https://mailtrap.io/inboxes for testing Email notifications


Use Admin And User token for the CRUD;

Credentials for admin
  email ="admin@gmail.com"
    password="password"

 Credentials for Driver
  email ="driver@gmail.com"
    password="password"
